This is a bunch of atspi examples that I used while working on
gnome-shell accessibility implementation:

* I needed to create terminal programs because it was complex to use
  accerciser while working on gnome-shell. For any other application,
  my recommendation is still use accerciser, as has a lot of more
  options.

* They were written in C because at some periods (mostly due the
  python3 migration), it was complex to get those programs done in
  python. Was easier to write them in C that fix the python
  dependencies issues.

* There are also some scripts written in javascript, initially created
  to test the gobject-introspected bindings, after finding that those
  had some bugs not found on pyatspi2. It would be good to get the
  same functionality of the C programs.

Eventually, those examples could be part of atspi itself. But probably
it also makes sense to keep them as a different repository, so we can
have examples written in different languages (only C written examples
fit on atspi)
